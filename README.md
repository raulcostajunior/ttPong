# ttPong
ttPong, **T**wo **T**humbs **Pong**, is a reboot, for mobile phones, of the 
classic Pong game. The basic idea is to be your own "opponent" and to win by
hitting the disc (ball) as many times as you can. 

ttPong is a native iOS app written in Swift. It uses *SpriteKit* and has some
pretty basic integration with *GameCenter* for supporting global Leader Boards.
Since October, 2020, ttPong can installed from the *AppStore* as a free application.
